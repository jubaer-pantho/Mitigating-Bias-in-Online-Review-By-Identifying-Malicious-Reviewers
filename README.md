# Mitigating-Bias-in-Online-Review-By-Identifying-Malicious-Reviewers


This work presents a model to mitigate bias in online review by automatically detecting untrusted reviewers and excluding them from the calculation. Our empirical study on the Amazon food reviews dataset demonstrates that the proposed approach is highly effective.


To run the code: 

python true-review.py

Please read the attached report for detail.
